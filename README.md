## My process
I started out with structuring the html for the page. Created a div to contain the image and text, then started working on the positioning of the div and the content nested within it. 
After using properties such margin, padding, position and text-align for the positioning, I then proceeding to adding the properties such as color, font-family and font size.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

While working on this on this project I was able determine how good I was at structuring a page using html and styling with just basic and intermediate CSS.
I need to work on my ability to manipulate the margin property to get my desired result and polish my use of the position property.
I also also learnt about the viewport tag.

### Continued development

I need to work on my ability to manipulate the margin property to get my desired result and polish my use of the position property.
I need to learn about building a website to fit multiple viewport.
